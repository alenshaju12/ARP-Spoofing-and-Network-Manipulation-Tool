# ARP-Spoofing-and-Network-Manipulation-Tool
This Python script demonstrates ARP Spoofing (also known as ARP Poisoning) techniques using the Scapy library. ARP Spoofing is often used in network security research to intercept, manipulate, or degrade network traffic between devices.

Features:
ARP Spoofing: The script sends ARP reply packets to spoof the ARP tables of the target device and router, making both believe that the attacker's machine is the other party. This can enable Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks and allow the attacker to intercept or modify the data flowing between the devices.
Network Degradation: By redirecting traffic through the attacker’s machine, the script can cause significant network slowness, delays, and even packet loss. The target device may experience slowdowns in its internet speed, lag in communication, and intermittent connectivity issues, disrupting its network performance.
ARP Request Broadcast: The tool sends ARP requests to periodically refresh the ARP cache, ensuring that the spoofed ARP entries persist.
Continuous Spoofing: The script runs in a loop, sending ARP spoofing packets at regular intervals to maintain the attack and degrade the network performance over time.
How it works:
ARP Spoofing: The script sends ARP reply packets to both the target device and router. The target device is made to think that the attacker’s machine is the router, and the router is made to think that the attacker’s machine is the target device.
Network Interruption: The attacker can then slow down the network, causing packet delays, dropped packets, or poor connectivity for the target device. This happens because traffic is being relayed through the attacker’s machine, which may introduce latency or not forward all packets, leading to performance issues.
ARP Request Broadcast: Periodic ARP requests are broadcasted to refresh the ARP cache and keep the spoofed routes active in the network.
Ongoing Disruption: The attack persists as long as the script is running, and the network connection may continue to suffer degraded performance.
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Scapy Library: Install it using pip install scapy.
Usage:
Edit the script to specify the correct IP and MAC addresses for the target device and attacker.
Run the script with administrative privileges (root or sudo) to send ARP packets and manipulate the network.
Monitor the target device for slow network speeds, packet loss, and delayed communication as a result of the ARP poisoning.
Disclaimer:
This script is intended for educational purposes and network security research only. It should not be used for unauthorized access or attacks on networks that you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Deliberate misuse of this tool can result in network disruption and violations of laws.
